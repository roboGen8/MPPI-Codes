Model Predictive Path Integral Approach for Trajectory Guidance of Rotorcraft Shipboard landing

You need to have gcc and nvcc to run the programs
For the C implementation, type:
make
./MPPI
For the CUDA C implementation, type:
nvcc pathInegral.cu -o pathIntegral
./pathIntegral

You should see the running times of the programs printed

If there is any problem compiling or running the program,
you need to check if you have the necessary software downloaded on your machine
you should also check if you have the allowed GPU cards to run CUDA
